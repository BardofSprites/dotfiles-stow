** Colorsets
I have implemented colors from [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs][Protesilaos Stavrou's]] wonderful ~modus-themes~ and ~ef-themes~ GNU Emacs packages as FVWM colorsets. You can check out the screenshots for [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes-pictures][modus-themes]] and [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures][ef-themes]] to preview the colors if you don't want to test out my dotfiles.

* Scripts
** Common Lisp/Scheme Scripts
My Common Lisp/Scheme scripts are located in ~bin/.local/bin/scripts/lisp/~.
*** ~study.lisp~
A simple work session manager with notifications.
